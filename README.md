# Enhancing-Email-Security-A-biologically-inspired-algoritm-for-spam-detection-in-machine-learning-
This project aims to enhance email spam detection through the integration of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) algorithm. The proposed approach leverages GA's evolutionary principles to optimize feature selection and model parameters, enhancing the efficiency of spam classification. Additionally, HHO, inspired by the hunting behavior of Harris's Hawks, contributes to further optimization of the algorithm. The combination of these evolutionary techniques aims to improve accuracy and reduce false positives in email spam detection, offering a robust solution to combat evolving spam tactics.
